# Stack Overflow for Teams Data Export (so4t_data_export)
An API script for Stack Overflow for Teams that creates a JSON export of users, user groups, tags, articles, questions, answers, and comments. It uses a combination of both versions of the API (i.e. 2.3 and 3) in order to create the most comprehensive export possible.

All data obtained via the API is handled locally on the device from which the script is run. The script does not transmit data to other parties, such as Stack Overflow. All of the API calls performed are read only, so there is no risk of editing or adding content on your Stack Overflow for Teams instance.

This script is offered with no formal support from Stack Overflow. If you run into issues using the script, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_data_export/issues) and/or reach out to the person who provided it to you. You are also welcome to edit the script to suit your needs.

## Requirements
* A Stack Overflow for Teams instance (Basic, Business, or Enterprise)
* Python 3.x ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Operating system: Linux, MacOS, or Windows

## Setup
[Download](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_data_export/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack the contents of this repository

**Installing Dependencies**

* Open a terminal window (or, for Windows, a command prompt)
* Navigate to the directory where you unpacked the files
* Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

**API Authentication**

For the Basic and Business tiers, you'll need an API token. For Enterprise, you'll need to obtain both an API key and an API token.

* For Basic or Business, instructions for creating a personal access token (PAT) can be found in [this KB article](https://stackoverflow.help/en/articles/4385859-stack-overflow-for-teams-api).
* For Enteprise, documentation for creating the key and token can be found within your instance, at this url: `https://[your_site]/api/docs/authentication`

Creating an access token for Enterpise can sometimes be tricky for people who haven't done it before. Here are some (hopefully) straightforward instructions:
* Go to the page where you created your API key. Take note of the "Client ID" associated with your API key.
* Go to the following URL, replacing the base URL, the `client_id`, and base URL of the `redirect_uri` with your own:
`https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/dialog?client_id=111&redirect_uri=https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success`
* You may be prompted to login to Stack Overflow Enterprise, if you're not already. Either way, you'll be redirected to a page that simply says "Authorizing Application"
* In the URL of that page, you'll find your access token. Example: `https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success#access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

## Usage
In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the script. 
Run the script using the following format, replacing the URL, token, and/or key with your own:
* For Basic and Business: `python3 so4t_data_export.py --url "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/TEAM-NAME" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`
* For Enterprise: `python3 so4t_data_export.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`

The script can take several minutes to run, particularly as it gathers data via the API. As it runs, it will continue to update the terminal window with the tasks it's performing.

When the script completes, it will indicate the JSON files will be created in the same directory where the script is located. The files will be named as follows: articles.json, questions_answers_comments.json, tags.json, user_groups.json, and users.json.

## Known Limitations
* Images are not exported
* Collections and Communities do not have an API endpoint, so they are not exported
